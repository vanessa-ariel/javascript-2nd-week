## Document Object Model (DOM)

DOM is a representation of the document we want to modify. In this case, the HTML file. For example, in this repository, DOM is used to acces the HTML file and modify it using JavaScript.

### Methods

document.getElementById("")

QuerySelector will use the first element that appears in the file, even though there are multiple ones. So if it's a class, make sure it's unique.

### NODE

Everything inside the document is a node; even comments, title, text.

ID is not used for CSS, usually.
